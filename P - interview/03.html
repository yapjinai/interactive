				<li>you seem to very rarely drop your flippant GFOTY persona, even in interviews -
				<ul>
					<li>the only time I’ve seen you appear sincere or serious was your apology online after something you’d said was perceived as racist.</li>
					<li>I thought it was interesting that you made an exception during that particular controversy.</li>

			Is the

					There is always a time and place where one has to drop a personality, and if one has caused unintentional upset then that is probably a good time to be serious for a minute.

		<a></a>
			
					The problem about being two different people however, is that
					<span class="answer">the outside world tend to want to hate Polly</span>
					, and 
					<span class="answer">expect Polly to be some sort of egotistical, confident, evil bitch</span>
					, which is pretty much far from the truth.

					But there is always a constant battle in my brain and i do keep needing to
					<span class="answer">remind myself that I am not this evil person</span>
					people want to believe I am. With the whole controversy, it felt like people in my social group were almost
					<span class="answer">enjoying it to some extent</span>
					, like they were
					<span class="answer">enjoying my fall</span>
					, but you can't let stuff get in your way.
