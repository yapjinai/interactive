		Van der Velden's association of design with consumer culture, and the unnecessity of (high-end) "design," really struck me: it helped me articulate to myself why I, who consider myself closer to the art world than to the design world, tend to shy away from the latter. Though I try to avoid both "worlds" and the conventions and hierarchies that have developed in them, the "pointlessness" or "uselessness" of art resonate with me, while the purpose of design - to better facilitate the use of an object (be it a machine, garment, or magazine) for other people - is a bit too utilitarian for my liking. Craft is similar to design in that its focus is on skill and functionality, but craft pushes back against an increasingly mechanized and automated world (a traditional potter or weaver is "useless" compared to a ceramic or fabric factory) while design, in my limited understanding of it, attempts to work in conjunction with it. All three of these fields are important and necessary, but I am most interested in the places in those fields in which they acknowledge their own "uselessness" and take themselves less seriously, something that design certainly is capable of doing.
