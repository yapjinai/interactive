	Whatever art is to the individual artist, its physical and visual form should consciously reflect in some way the content, ideas, or ideals it is meant to represent. I am not a student of the Yale Art School, so I do not know enough to decide how it should represent itself online. I do like the collaborative nature of the current website, though I find it interesting that even those who have access to a wiki account and can edit the pages can only do so within a very limited scope (primarily by changing the page's background to something garish, or sometimes the page's text). It's also interesting that even though undergrads have personal pages which would theoretically describe their work, they have no means of actually making any changes; the student's limited role in modifying the website might reflect their limited agency in other respects in the school's functioning.

	If I were to update the website, I'd give students a little more control over the layout and format. Since they are students, it would be fitting if editing the website were itself a learning process. To take this pedagogic element to a very literal level, we might remove the wiki structure altogether and allow all students to make direct changes to their web page's HTML and CSS. Breaking your own artist website is the fastest way to learn.
