	Gucci Gucci, Louis Louis, Fendi Fendi, Prada
	I'm lookin' like Madonna but I'm flossing like Ivana
	Trump, you know I keep that work in my trunk
	Got my hand on the pump if you wanna press your luck
	I'm yelling "Free V-Nasty" 'til my throat is raspy
	Young, rich and flashy I be where the cash be
	You can't find that? I think you need a Google Map
	My pearl-handled kitty-cat will leave and press your noodle back
	Now Google that groupies follow me like Twitter
	I'm rolling up my catnip and shitting in your litter
	Why you looking bitter? I be looking better
	The type of bitch that make you wish that you ain't never met her
	The editor, director plus I'm my own boss
	So posh, nails fierce with the gold gloss
	Which means nobody getting over me
	I got the swag and it's pumping out my ovaries
