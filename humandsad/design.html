			<!-- Yeah, I very much like the idea that you're playing as a fake artist. I wonder if the name could be more believable than "Humand Sad"? I think it's a little too close to fake right now. Maybe an anagram of that? An anagram of your name?

			I enjoy the "Contact" page. Should there be a CV too? Any other conventions you could play with?

			I also think there could be metadata for each image. Materials, years, etc. Might be good to look at how real artists and museums caption their works. -->
