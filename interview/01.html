		As for GFOTY, I do'nt particularly think she knows an awful lot about politics(!) So she is more than happy for it to come across like that because people will then think she is clever and thats all GFOTY wants!

		GFOTY looks deeply in to Polly Louisa Salmons life and then turns her life in to an extremity which probably shouldn't be viewed by the public, but

		<span class="answer">Dog Food origins, was really just a business plan to make a killer batch of dog food for all the dogs out there</span> but <span class="answer">GFOTY and Spinee got in an argument about the ingredients, and that was that.</span> <span class="answer">They were both too <a href="02.html">power hungry</a></span>!
